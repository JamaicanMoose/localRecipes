Status report:

1. We began working on the server and the front end 
   for the project. We have part of the GET request
   for retrieving local foods done and have 
   created a basic react component for the 
   form for the user to fill out with their information

2. The biggest issue we encountered was getting 
   things set up for team members on Windows machines.
   Also, learning how to use ReactJS and none of us 
   have extensive experience with it. 

3. By the next week we hope to have a working 
   form for user input, a list component that 
   will ultimately store all the recipes 
   retrieved, and a finished scraper for getting
   local foods for the user's location.
